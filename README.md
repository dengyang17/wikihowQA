# WikiHowQA-Dataset
WikiHowQA is a Community-based Question Answering dataset, which can be used for both answer selection and abstractive summarization tasks. The dataset is introduced in Joint Learning of Answer Selection and Answer Summary Generation in Community Question Answering (AAAI 2020).
We construct the WikiHowQA dataset based on a summarzation dataset, WikiHow (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09305), and using the online WikiHow (http://www.wikihow.com/) knowledge base <sup>[*](#footnote1)</sup>.
