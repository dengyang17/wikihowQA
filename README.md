# WikiHowQA-Dataset
WikiHowQA is a Community-based Question Answering dataset, which can be used for both answer selection and abstractive summarization tasks. The dataset is introduced in **Joint Learning of Answer Selection and Answer Summary Generation in Community Question Answering (AAAI 2020)** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09801).

The WikiHowQA dataset can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cpd0nXX5d4PbIYOyaDV-BTg3XyruKLXo

We construct the WikiHowQA dataset based on a summarzation dataset, WikiHow (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09305), and using the online WikiHow (http://www.wikihow.com/) knowledge base <sup>[*](#footnote1)</sup>. 

More detailed information will be added soon.
